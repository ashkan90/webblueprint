## Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

### Title
Selection of Primary Database Technology for WebBlueprint Asset Management

### Status
ACCEPTED

### Context
WebBlueprint requires a database solution to store and manage complex visual programming assets similar to Unreal Engine's Blueprint system. These assets include workspaces, blueprints, functions, variables, and other components with complex relationships between them. The system needs to support versioning, referential integrity, efficient querying, and potential real-time collaboration.

We need a database solution that:
- Efficiently stores hierarchical and graph-like structures
- Supports schema evolution as new node types are added
- Maintains integrity between related assets
- Delivers strong query performance for various access patterns
- Provides robust versioning capabilities
- Can scale with growing user workspaces and asset complexity

### Decision
**We will use PostgreSQL with JSONB as our primary database technology for WebBlueprint.**

Specifically:
1. Structured data (users, workspaces, assets metadata) will be stored in traditional relational tables
2. Complete blueprint structures will be stored as JSONB documents in specialized tables
3. References between assets will be tracked in dedicated tables for performance
4. Versioning will be implemented using separate version records with full snapshots
5. GIN indexes will be used to enable efficient searches within JSONB documents

### Rationale
After extensive research and performance testing, PostgreSQL with JSONB emerged as the most balanced solution for our requirements:

1. **Technical Advantages:**
    - JSONB provides schema flexibility for evolving node types
    - Relational model ensures data integrity for critical relationships
    - Transaction support prevents data corruption during complex operations
    - GIN indexing enables efficient searches within blueprint structures
    - Single database simplifies operations and deployment
    - Built-in partitioning supports future scaling needs

2. **Performance Considerations:**
    - Performance testing showed PostgreSQL + JSONB handling our expected workloads efficiently
    - Complete blueprints (up to 5MB) were retrieved in under 25ms
    - Node searches within blueprints performed adequately (40ms average)
    - All blueprint sizes in our test dataset fit comfortably within JSONB capabilities

3. **Operational Benefits:**
    - Widely adopted technology with excellent community support
    - Rich ecosystem of management and monitoring tools
    - Simpler operational model compared to multi-database solutions
    - Clear scaling paths when needed

4. **Future Adaptability:**
    - Provides a solid foundation that can be augmented with specialized solutions if needed
    - Allows incremental migration of specific features to other databases if justified

### Alternatives Considered

#### MongoDB
- **Pros:** Native JSON document model, slightly better performance for document retrieval
- **Cons:** Weaker referential integrity, transaction support added only in recent versions, more complex scaling for our use case

#### Neo4j
- **Pros:** Excellent for relationship queries and reference tracking
- **Cons:** Less efficient for storing complete blueprint structures, higher operational complexity

#### Hybrid Approach (PostgreSQL + MongoDB + Redis)
- **Pros:** Optimized storage and queries for different aspects of the system
- **Cons:** Significantly higher development and operational complexity, consistency challenges across databases

### Consequences

#### Positive
1. **Simplified Architecture** - Single database technology simplifies development, deployment, and operations
2. **Data Integrity** - Transactional support ensures consistent data, particularly important for concurrent edits
3. **Query Flexibility** - Can efficiently handle both structured queries and document-oriented access patterns
4. **Operational Familiarity** - Team has strong existing expertise with PostgreSQL
5. **Migration Path** - Provides clear options for future scaling and optimization

#### Negative
1. **Document Retrieval Performance** - Pure document databases like MongoDB might offer marginally better performance for simple document retrieval
2. **Specialized Query Limitations** - Graph queries will be less efficient than in a dedicated graph database like Neo4j
3. **Schema Maintenance** - Will require careful index management and occasional schema updates

#### Neutral
1. **Initial Development Effort** - Similar to other database choices
2. **Operational Complexity** - Standard database maintenance procedures apply

### Implementation Strategy

We will implement this decision in phases:

1. **Foundation (Month 1):**
    - Set up PostgreSQL with the core schema
    - Implement basic asset and blueprint storage
    - Establish initial indexing strategy

2. **Optimization (Month 2-3):**
    - Fine-tune JSONB document structure
    - Develop efficient query patterns
    - Implement reference tracking

3. **Scaling Preparation (Month 4+):**
    - Implement monitoring to identify potential bottlenecks
    - Prepare for read replicas and connection pooling as needed
    - Define partitioning strategy for future growth

4. **Evolutionary Approach:**
    - Continuously evaluate performance against requirements
    - Add Redis for caching frequent blueprint access if needed
    - Consider specialized databases for specific features only when justified by performance data

### Monitoring and Review Plan

This decision will be reviewed:
- After the first 100,000 blueprints are created in production
- If any query performance consistently exceeds 100ms response time
- If blueprint sizes regularly exceed 5MB
- After implementing real-time collaboration features
- Annually as part of our technology stack review
